    For OF loop cannot be used with objects. In this case you can use object.entries()
    <br>
    If you don't want to use entries, there is the For In loop.
    <script>
      const cuts = ['Burger', 'Ribs', 'Sausage', 'Meatball'];
      
      //destructure the array of cuts - entries gives us an iterator
      for (const [i, cut] of cuts.entries()) {
        console.log(`${cut} is the ${i + 1}th item`);
      }
      
      // Array.of(21, 34, 678, 543, 78) creates an array with the arguments that you pass it.
      // Array.from(arguments) also creates an array from the argument you pass it, but the argument can be something like an object.
